Arch provides its users with official software repositories from which they can install apps and update software as needed. The Arch developers maintain these repositories, and the software in them is guaranteed to have passed bug and security testing before being made available to end users.

However, the amount of software available for Linux is limitless. Therefore, any Linux distrо can only house some of them in its repositories.

While having one of the largest and most software-rich repositories in the Linux world, the number of available software in Arch’s repositories is still limited. To address this limitation, Arch has developed the AUR repository.

[AUR (Arch User Repository)](https://aur.archlinux.org/) is a software repository for Arch users maintained by Arch users. Its purpose is to house all of the software that has not found a home in the official Arch Linux repositories. It is a treasure trove of tens of thousands of software packages maintained by the Arch community, and you can find almost anything there.

Of course, the packages in AUR, which are maintained voluntarily by Arch users worldwide, cannot guarantee the same level of stability as those in official repositories.

However, this does not imply that the software is untrustworthy – quite the contrary. AUR has a system in place for users to vote on and report on the packages so that it may be resolved immediately if an issue emerges.

On top of that, the AUR voting system frequently results in packages with a high number of votes being included in the official Arch repository due to their widespread use and interest.

With that out of the way, let’s look at how you can easily use AUR and install packages from there using [[AUR Helpers]].
