Risk = Threat x Vulnerability (or likelihood).

We can also use: Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact
Total Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Asset Value
Residual Risk = Total Risk - Countermeasures

there are to ways to analyze Risk for an organization:
	**Qualitative Risk Analysis** - How likely is it to happen and how bad is it if it happens?
	**Quantitative Risk Analysis** - What will it actually cost us in $?

**Due Diligence and Due Care:** 
	**Due Diligence:** Doing the research before implementation.
		**DD** - Do Detect
	**Due Care:** It is the implementation.
		**DC** - Do Correct

## **The Risk Management life cycle is iterative.

* Identify our Risk Management team.
* What is in and what is out of scope?
* What are the acceptable risk levels, which type of risk appetite do we have in our enterprise?

## **Risk Assessment
Quantitative and Qualitative Risk Anaylsis.
* Risk Mitigation (Reduce).
* Risk Transference (Share).
* Risk Acceptance.
* Risk Avoidance.
* Risk rejection is Never acceptable.
* We assess the current countermeasures.

Let's look at an example, for example an asset like a laptop.
* How likely is one to get stolen or left somewhere?
* How bad is it if it happens?
below we can see how this risk dynamic would work depending on the case study we are trying to protect.

## **Quantitative Risk Analysis**
This is where we put a number on our assets and risks.
	 - Asset Value (AV)
	 - Exposure factor (EF)
	 - Single Loss Expentancy (SLE) = (AV x EF)
	 - Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
	 - Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
	 - Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
