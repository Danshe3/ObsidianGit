 **What is Networking?** 
 A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources or data.
We use defense-in-depth on our internal network and when our data traverses the internet.
- **Simplex** is a one-way communication.
- **Half-Duplex** communication sends or receives at one time only.
- **Full-duplex** communication sends and receives simultaneously.

- **Baseband** networks have one channel and can only send one signal at a time.
- **Broadband** networks have multiple channels and can send and receive multiple signals at a time.

- **Internet** is a global collection of peered WAN networks, it really is a patchwork of ISPs.
- **Intranet** is an organization's privately owned network.
- **Extranet** is a connection between private Intranets.


**Circuit Switching** Expensive, but always available, used less often.
	- A dedicated communications channel through the network.
	- The circuit guarantees the full bandwidth

**Packet Switching** Cheap, but no capacity guarantee, very widely used today.
	- Data is sent in packets but take multiple different paths to the destination.
	- **QoS (Quality of Service)** gives specific traffic priority over other traffic.
		- Most commonly VOIP (Voice over IP) or other UDP traffic needing close to real time communication.


**PAN (Personal Area Network)** 
	A personal area network is a computer network used for communication among computers and other information technological  devices close to one person.
**LAN (Local Area Network)**
	A network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area.
**MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**
	A large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.
**WAN (Wide Area Network)** 
	A computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances.
**GAN (Global Area Network)**
	A global area network, is a network used for supporting mobile users across a number of wireless LANs, stellite coverage areas, ... the transition from one to the next can be seamless.
**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**
	A VPN network sends private data over an insecure network, most often the internet.
