## Networking Cables:
When it comes to networking cables, most people think RJ45 Copper Ethernet cables, many more types are used though.
	- **Crosstalk** is the signal crossing from one cable to another, this can be confidentiality issue.
	- **Attenuation** is the signal getting weaker the farther it travels.

___
All cable measurements are in metric system (m/km).

___

<span class="red-bg">EMI (Electromagnetic Interference):</span> Magnetism that can disrupt data availability and integrity.

### Twisted Pair Cables:
**UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair):** Pairs of twisted pairs of cables.
Twisting them makes them less susceptible of EMI.
1 cable sends and 1 receives data.
**STP (Shielded Twisted Pair):** Has extra metal mesh shielding around each pair of cables, making them less susceptible to EMI, but also making the cables thicker, stiffer, and more expensive.

## Fiber Optic Cables:
Use light to carry data (vs. electricity for copper cables):
**PROS:** Speed 1 Petabit per second, 35miles/50km over a single fiber.
	- Distance, it has no attenuation like copper
	- Not susceptible to EMI.
**CONS:** Price, more difficult to use, you can break the glass in the cable if you are not careful.

**Single-Mode fiber** A single strand of fiber carries a single mode of light (down the center), used for long distance cables (Often used in IP-Backbones).
**Multi-Mode fiber** Uses multiple modes (light colors)
 to carry multiple data streams simultaneously, this is done with WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing).
