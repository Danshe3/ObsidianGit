[[Certification Study]] 

1. Which type of access control model would we use if confidentiality was the MOST important factor to us?
	-  **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**
		Often used when Confidentiality is most important. Access to an object is determined by labels and clearance, this is often used in the military or in organizations where confidentiality is very important.
		
2. Paul asks his manager Naomi why separation of roles is important. What is the MOST likely answer Naomi will give to Paul?
	- **No one person has complete control over a transaction or an activity**
		Separation of roles will limit what people can do, in such a way that no one person has complete control over a transaction, so that irregularities cannot be hidden. Employees from different departments should work together. Avoiding conflicts of interest is the principle of segregation of duties. The military sometimes divides the knowledge required to complete key tasks to ensure there is two-person control; the task cannot be completed unless both persons are present.

3. Implementing our access control mode, you are asked, "In which type of access management would you use access lists?" What do you anser?
	- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** 
		DAC (Discretionary Access Control): Often used when availability is most important. Uses DACLs (Discretionary access lists), based on user identity. Access to an object is assigned at the discretion of the object owner. The owner can add, remove rights, commonly used by most OS'.
