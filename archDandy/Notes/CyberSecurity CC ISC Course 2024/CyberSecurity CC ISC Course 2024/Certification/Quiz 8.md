1. An IPv4 address consist of how many bits?
	-  **32 bit**
		IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) addresses: IPv4 addresses are made up of 4 octets (dotted-decimal notation) and broken further down in a 32 bit integer binary.
		
2. After our latest implementation of IPv6 128-bit addresses, our MAC addresses have also changed. Which format are they in now?
	- **EUI/MAC-64**
		IPv6 uses EUI/MAC-64 addresses. If the card is EUI/MAC-48 it adds “fffe” to get a 64-bit address.

3. In which of these protocols, is IPSEC built into and NOT added on later?
	- **IPv6** 
		IPSEC (Internet Protocol Security): Set of protocols that provide a cryptographic layer to IP traffic; IPv4, it is bolted on. For IPv6, it is designed into the protocol.
