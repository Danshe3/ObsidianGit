#section3 #cybersecurity 

Involves the monitoring and detection of security events on our systems, and how we react in those events.

We can categorize disasters in 3 categories: Natural, Human, Environmental.

**Natural:** Anything caused by nature
**Human:** Anything caused by humans
**Environmental (not to be confused by disasters):** Anything in our environment.

**Event:** An observable change in state.
**Alert:** Triggers warnings if certain events happens.

**Incident:**
	- **multiple adverse:** events happening on our systems or network.
	- **Problem:** Incidence with an unknown cause.
	- **Inconvenience (Non-disasters):** Non-disruptive failures.
	- **Emergency (Crisis):** Urgent
	- **Disaster:** Our entire facility is unusable for 24 hours or longer.
	- **Catastrophe:** Our facility is destroyed.

1. **Preparation:** These are all the steps we take to prepare for incidences.
2. **Detection:** Events are analyzed to determine if they might be a security incident.
3. **Response:** The response phase is when the incident response team begins interacting with affected systems and attempts to keep further damage from occurring as a result of the incident.
5. **Mitigation:** We understand the cause of the incident so that the system can be reliably cleaned and restored to operational status later in the recovery phase.
6. **Reporting:** We report throughout the process beginning with the detection.
7. **Recovery:** We carefully restore the system or systems to operational status.
8. **Remediation:** The remediation happens during the mitigation phase.
9. **Lessons Learned:** This is often overlooked, we removed the problem, we have implemented new controls and safeguards.
10. **Root-Cause Analysis:** We attempt to determine the underlying weakness of vulnerability that allowed the incident to happen.
