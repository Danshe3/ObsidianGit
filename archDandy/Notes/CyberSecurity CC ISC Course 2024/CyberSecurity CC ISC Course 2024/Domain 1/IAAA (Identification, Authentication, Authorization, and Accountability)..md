**Identification**:
	Anything that can verify the identity of a user, such as your name, username, ID number, employee number, SSN and so on.
**Authentication:**
	 This is something that gives evidence that you are indeed yourself, this can be done with: 
	 - something you know, Type 1 Authentication
	 - something you have, Type 2 Authentication
	 - something you are, Type 3 Authentication 

Within these examples, type 3 authentication is the MOST secure option while type 1 is the LEAST secure one.

We also have 2 other authentication methods:
	- **Physiological Characteristics**:  Uses the shape of the body, these do not change unless a drastic event occurs.
	- **Behavioral Characteristics:** Uses the pattern of behavior of a person, these can change, but most often revert back to the baseline.

**Least Privilege** - (Minimum necessary access).
	We give our users/systems exactly the access they need, no more, no less.
**Need to Know** 
	Even if you have access, if you do not need to know, then you should not access the data.
**MAC (Mandatory Access Control)**
	Often used when confidentiality is most important.
	- **Labels:** Objects have labels assigned to them.
	- **Clearance:** Subjects have Clearance assigned to them.

Some access control models are:
	- [[RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)]]
	- [[ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)]]
	- [[Context - Based Access Control & Content - Based Access Control]]

**Accountability** (often referred to as "Auditing"):
	Traces an Action to a Subject's Identity.
**Non-Repudiation:**
	A user cannot deny having performed a certain action.
