## Access Control Categories:
**Administrative (Directive) Controls:** Organizational policies and procedures.

**Technical Controls:** Hardware / Software / Firmware - Firewalls, routers, encryption.

**Physical Controls:** Locks, fences, guards, dogs, gates, bollards.

## Access Control Types:
**Recovery:** Controls that help us Recover after an attack.

**Deterrent:** Controls that Deter an attack.

**Compensating:** Controls that Compensate.

## Perimeter Defense:
**Fences:** Smaller fences such as 3 ft. (1 m) can be a deterrence, while taller ones, such as 8 ft. (2.4 m) can be a prevention mechanism.

**Gates:** (Deterernce, Preventative): Placed at controls points at the perimeter.

**ASTM Standard:** 
	- Class I Residential
	- Class II commercial/General Access
	- Class III Industrial/Limited Access
	- Class IV Restricted Access

**Bollards (Preventative):** Used to prevent cars or trucks from entering an area while allowing foot traffic to pass.

**Lights (Detective and Deterrence):** Lights should be used to fully illuminate the entire area.

**CCTV (Closed Circuit Television)** (Detective, Deterrence) - used to monitor the facility's perimeter and inside it.
	**Older cameras** are analog and use video tapes for storage (often VHS).
	**Modern cameras** are digital and use **CCD** (Charged Couple Device); also use a **DVR** (Digital Video Recorder).

**Locks (Preventative):**
	**Key Locks:**
		Requires a physical key to unlock
		**Key Bitting Code:** Can be copied and replicated.
		**Pin Tumbler Lock: (or Yale lock):** A lock mechanism that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key.
		**Lock Picking:** With a lock pick sets or bumping, opening a lock without the key.
		**Lock Bumping:** - Using a shaved-down key that matches the lock.
	**Combination Locks:**
		Not very secure and have limited accountability even with unique codes.
		Should be used for low-security areas.

**Cards:**
	**Smart Cards (contact or contactless):** They contain a computer circuit, using ICC (Integrated Circuit Card).
	**Contact Cards:** Inserted into a machine to be read.
	**Contactless Cards:** Can be read by proximity.
	**Magnetic Stripe Cards:** Swiped through a reader, no circuit. VERY ease to duplicate.

**Tailgating/Piggybacking:** Following someone authorized into an area you are not authorized to be in.

**Mantrap:** A Mantrap is a room with 2 doors; Door 1 must close completely before Door 2 can be opened.

**Turnstiles: (Preventative, Deterrence):** Also prevents tailgating, by allowing only 1 person to enter per Authentication.

**Contraband Checks (Preventative, Detective, Deterrent):** Often seen in airports, courthouses, intelligence offices or other higher security facilities.

**Motion Detectors (Detective, Deterrence):** Used to alert staff by triggering an alarm (silent or not).

**Ultrasound, Microwave, Infrared or Laser (Detective, Deterrence):** Active sensors, they send energy (sound, wave, or light).

**Perimeter Alarms:** Door/Window sensors - these are the thin strips around the edges of either or contact sensors.

**Walls, Floors, and Ceilings:** In line with our layered defense strategy, the strong security encountered in getting to a data center does nothing if there is a crawl space that an attacker can use.

**Guards (Deterrent, Detective, Preventative, Compensating):** Guards can serve many diverse purposes for an organization.

**Dogs (Deterrent, Detective, Compensating):** Most often used in controlled, enclosed areas. Liability can be an issue.

**Restricted Work Areas and Escorts:** 
	- To track and funnel authorized visitors, we can use visitor badges, visitor logs, and escorts.
	- Non-electronic visitor badges are easy to make copies of and easy to fake.
