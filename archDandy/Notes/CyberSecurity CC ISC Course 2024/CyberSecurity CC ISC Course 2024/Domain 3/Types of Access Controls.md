### **Technical Security Controls**
**DAC (Discretionary Access Control):** Often used when Availability is most important.
	Access to an object is assigned at the discretion of the object owner.

**MAC (Mandatory Access Control):** Often used when Confidentiality is most important.
	Access to an object is determined by labels and clearance.
	**Labels:** Objects have Labels assigned to them.
	**Clearance:** Subjects have Clearance assigned to them.

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Often used when Integrity is most important.
	Policy neutral access control mechanism defined around roles and privileges.

**ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control):**
	Access to objects is granted based on subjects, objects AND environmental conditions.
	Attributes could be:
		- Subject (user)
		- Object (resource)
		- Environment

**Context-Based Access Control:**
	Access to an object is controlled based on certain contextual parameters, such as location, time, sequence of responses, access history.

**Content-Based Access Control:**
	Access is provided based on the attributes or content of an object, then it is known as a content-dependent access control.
	


### **Logical Access Controls**

**Least Privilege and Need to Know.**
	**Least Privilege** -- (Minimum necessary access)
	We give our users/systems exactly the access they need, no more, no less.
	**Need to know** -- Even if you have access, if you do not need to know, then you should not access the data.
	**Separation of Duties** -- More than one individual in one single task is an internal control intended to prevent fraud and error.

**Administrative Security:** 
	**Job Rotation:** For the exam think of it to detect errors and frauds. It is easier to detect fraud and there is less chance of collusion between individuals if they rotate jobs.
	**Mandatory Vacations:** Done to ensure one perosn is not always performing the same task, someone else has to cover and it can keep fraud from happening or help us detect it.

**NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement):** 
	We covered NDAs between our and other organizations, it is also normal to have them for internal employees.

**Background Checks:** 
	References, Degrees, Employment, Criminal, Credit history (less common, more costly).
	For sensitive positions the background check is an ongoing process.

**Privilege Monitoring:** 
	 The more access and privilege an employee has the more we keep an eye on their activity.
